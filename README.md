# Google_clean_talk
A clean talk, harassment-free chat platform for Google hackathon.

## Mission
The main objective of our application **Google Clean Talk** is to create a safer, harassment-free, and reliable chat application by proactively identifying and flagging inappropriate content before it reaches the recipient. This application is designed to support respectful communication across professional, educational, and gaming chat platforms, aiming to protect individuals—especially women and other vulnerable users—from experiencing online bullying, harassment, and unwanted advances without prior consent. Using Google's real-time AI-driven content moderation, Google Clean Talk fosters a more inclusive and respectful digital space where all users can engage confidently and safely, whether in professional, academic, or gaming contexts.
This application "Google Clean Talk" aims to fulfill objective 5.2 of the Goal 5 targets highlighted in [UN SDG 5](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/gender-equality/).
